      <h4>Project Overview</h4>
      <div data-w-id="07e58832-f869-93ac-f148-d1e95494f652">
        <div class="rubrik-text-block">
          <div class="overview-div-block">
            <div class="bold-heading">Goal</div>
            <p>Our main goal was to make the app easier to use by creating clearer and more intuitive flows, reducing misclicks by about 50%. By simplifying navigation, we aimed to improve efficiency and make the experience smoother for users. We also wanted to boost engagement by adding interactive features, making the app more inviting and easier to adopt, which in turn would help users be more productive.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="overview-div-block">
            <div class="bold-heading">Context</div>
            <p>Dyamo was founded in 2020 by two women in Stockholm to tackle a major challenge: helping young people stay motivated and focused in their studies. Designed for Generation Z—who expect seamless, interactive digital experiences—the app needed a UX that was both highly functional and engaging.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="overview-div-block">
            <div class="bold-heading">My Contribution</div>
            <p>In this project, I helped enhance Dyamo’s user experience by streamlining navigation and minimizing friction in user interactions. I refined user flows to reduce misclicks and improved UI elements to boost interactivity. By considering Generation Z’s digital habits and expectations, I ensured the design was intuitive, engaging, and easy to use.</p>

      <h4>Problems</h4>
      <p>At the start of the project, we carefully planned our work for the next 18 weeks. Inspired by Design Thinking, we took an agile approach, allowing us to test and refine the design iteratively to achieve the best possible results.</p>
      <div class="div-block-problem-card">
        <div class="bold-heading">What needed to be improved</div>
        <p>One of the biggest challenges was optimizing Dyamo’s user flows to minimize unnecessary clicks and enhance usability. User testing revealed that navigation felt unintuitive, causing frustration and inefficiency. Another key challenge was balancing a modern yet playful design. Early tests showed that the app felt outdated and that the color scheme was distracting.</p>

            <div class="bold-heading red">optimizing Dyamo’s user flows</div>
            <p>Dyamo&#x27;s user flows had unnecessary steps and confusing navigation, making it harder for users to complete tasks efficiently.</p>

          <div class="overview-div-block">
            <div class="bold-heading">Research</div>
            <p>Since Dyamo already had a defined target audience—Generation Z—we focused our research on understanding their behaviors and expectations. We began with a competitive analysis to identify market gaps and successful design patterns in similar apps. In parallel, we analyzed survey responses from Dyamo’s users to gain deeper insights into their needs and pain points.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="overview-div-block">
            <div class="bold-heading"><strong>User Testing</strong></div>
            <p>To ensure our design changes had a real impact, we conducted 12 user tests, six on the initial prototype and six on the final design. These tests were essential in validating our improvements. We used the think-aloud method, where users verbalized their thoughts and actions as they navigated the app. Analyzing the results helped us identify what worked well and what needed refinement.<br></p>
          </div>
          <div class="overview-div-block">
            <div class="bold-heading">Wireframes</div>
            <p>Based on our findings, we implemented targeted design improvements to enhance the user experience. We streamlined user flows by eliminating unnecessary steps and reducing misclicks, making navigation more intuitive. The overall structure was reorganized to improve accessibility, ensuring users could easily find what they needed. Additionally, we refined the color scheme to create a more modern and cohesive visual identity. To validate these changes, we conducted additional user tests to measure their effectiveness and ensure they had the desired impact.</p>

      <div class="bold-heading results">Changes</div>
      <p>By implementing the changes we identified and tested, we created a more streamlined and user-friendly experience. The user flows became clearer and easier to follow, leading to a significant improvement in usability.<br><br>To help product owners better understand our design changes, we created a user story that illustrated the user’s journey through the app. This made it easier to visualize the improvements and see how the new flows would enhance the user experience.<br><br>As a result, navigation became much smoother. By optimizing user flows and reducing unnecessary steps, we decreased the average number of clicks per task by 83.3%. This allowed users to complete tasks more quickly and easily, increasing both satisfaction and engagement.<br></p>
